# GraphicsTemp

This repository contains interesting OpenGL projects I am working on. These projects explore various graphics programming concepts, including rendering, shaders, transformations, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- CMake
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW or GLAD (as needed by specific projects)
- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later

### Building the Projects
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphicstemp.git
   cd graphicstemp
   ```
2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```sh
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
3. Run CMake to generate the build files:
   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```sh
   cmake --build .
   ```

### Running the Projects
Once the build is complete, you can run any of the compiled executables from the `build` directory. For example:
```sh
./project_name
```
